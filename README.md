#Here’s a draft README.md you can use for your GitHub repository. I’ve structured it so others can clearly understand what each uploaded file does and how to run your genetic ancestry workflow. 
You can tweak the wording depending on your exact pipeline.

#Genetic Ancestry Analysis Workflow
This repository contains scripts and resources for performing genetic ancestry analysis on cohort datasets (e.g., MECA participants). The workflow integrates preprocessing, reference sample extraction, and downstream analysis.

#Repository Contents
##Scripts

1. extract_ref_sample.sh
Bash script for extracting reference population samples from VCF/PLINK datasets.
Typically used to subset reference individuals (e.g., 1000 Genomes Project) for ancestry comparisons.

2.script.py
Main Python script for running genetic ancestry analysis.
Performs quality control, merging of study and reference datasets, PCA, and visualization.
Can be customized to include additional analyses such as admixture modeling.

3.update_fam.py
Utility script for updating .fam files (used in PLINK).
Ensures consistent family and individual IDs across datasets.
Helpful when merging reference and cohort data.

4.Config / Workflow Files
meca_ancetsry_workflow.txt
Step-by-step outline of the ancestry analysis workflow.
Documents the sequence of commands (e.g., filtering, merging, PCA).
Serves as a protocol for reproducibility.

5.pop2group.txt
Mapping file linking population codes (e.g., YRI, CEU, CHB) to broader ancestry groups (e.g., African, European, East Asian).
Used for grouping individuals in PCA and ADMIXTURE plots.

#Requirements
PLINK 1.9+
Python 3.8+ with common packages:
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn
Bash (Linux/Mac) or WSL (Windows)

#Usage

1.Extract reference samples
bash extract_ref_sample.sh reference.vcf.gz

2.Update .fam file (if needed)
python update_fam.py dataset.fam updated_dataset.fam

3.Run ancestry analysis
python script.py --input merged_dataset --popmap pop2group.txt

4.Follow workflow guide
See meca_ancetsry_workflow.txt for the complete step-by-step pipeline.
